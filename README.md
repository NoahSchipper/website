# Noah Schipper's Portfolio Website

This is my personal website, built to showcase my background, technical skills, and the projects I've worked on. It’s a custom, responsive design with multiple pages and a clean, modern layout.

## Pages

Home (index.html) – The landing page with animated elements to grab attention.

Projects (projects.html) – A place to show off the work I’m proud of.

Contact (contact.html) – Easy ways to reach out, with linked icons and my email.

About (about.html) – A deeper look into who I am, what I do, and the technologies I work with.

## File Structure

└── README.md # This file

## Tools & Tech

I wrote everything using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The styling is kept consistent throughout, and everything is mobile-friendly. Some pages use animations, hover effects, and interactivity handled by custom scripts. No frameworks or libraries—just pure front-end code.

## Making Changes

If you’re looking through this as a developer or collaborator:

The HTML files are straightforward and organized by section.
Most of the visual styling is handled in styles.css.
JavaScript for the About page is in aboutScript.js.
JavaScript for the Contact page is in toast.js.
Assets like logos and documents (e.g. resume) are in the assets/ folder.

##Notes
I’ve included a copy of my resume in the assets folder. The site is still evolving, and I regularly update it as I learn new things or build new projects.

Thanks for taking a look!
